# Quantifying_Pressure
Personal project evaluating player skill under pressure using Statsbomb public event level data.

Main idea of the project is to use Expected threat, as described [I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)
 by Karun Singh, to quantify how soccer players react to defensive pressure.
