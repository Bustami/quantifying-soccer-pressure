# Quantifying_Pressure
Personal project evaluating player skill under pressure using Statsbomb public event level data.

Main idea of this project is to use Expected threat, as introduced by Karun Singh [here](https://karun.in/blog/expected-threat.html), to quantify how soccer players react to defensive pressure.
